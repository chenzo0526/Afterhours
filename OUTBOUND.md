# Afterhours — Outbound System (v1)

This is the daily execution plan.

---

## Target List Rules

We only contact:
- Local service businesses
- 3–50 employees
- Emergency-prone trades

Sources:
- Google Maps
- Yelp
- Angi
- CSV scrapes

Avoid franchises for now.

## Cold Email #1 (Day 1)

Subject:
Missed calls after hours?

Body:
Hey {{Name}},

Quick note — we help service businesses capture after-hours calls so owners don’t miss details or get woken up for nonsense.

We take calls you forward, tag urgency, and send a clean summary the next morning.

If you want, we can run it quietly for a week so you can see what you’re missing.

Worth a quick chat?

– {{Your Name}}

## Cold Email #2 (Day 3)

Subject:
Quick follow-up

Body:
{{Name}},

Just following up — after-hours calls are where many missed opportunities happen.

Happy to run this quietly for a week so you can see the summaries before deciding.

Let me know.

– {{Your Name}}

## Cold Email #3 (Day 6)

Subject:
Last note

Body:
{{Name}},

If after-hours calls aren’t an issue, no worries.

If they are, happy to show how we capture and summarize them without changing your daytime setup.

– {{Your Name}}

## Call Follow-Up (After Email #2)

Opening line:
“Hey {{Name}}, this is {{You}} — I sent a quick note about handling after-hours calls. Did I catch you at a bad time?”

If yes → ask for time.
If no → pitch.

## Success Criteria

- Email replies
- Calls booked
- Ghost runs started

No metrics beyond that yet.
