# Afterhours — Product Definition

## What We Do (Plain English)

When calls are forwarded after hours, we capture details and notify the on-call contact.

Non-urgent requests are logged and summarized.
Urgent situations are prioritized for notification.
Delivery and response depend on carrier reliability and your team’s availability.

Customers keep calling the same number they always have.
