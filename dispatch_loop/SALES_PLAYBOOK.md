# Afterhours — Sales Playbook (v1)

This is the ONLY sales flow. No improvising.

## ICP (Who We Sell To)
Local service businesses that:
- Miss after-hours calls
- Rely on emergencies or urgent jobs
- Have owners burned out by night calls

Examples: Plumbing, HVAC, Electrical, Restoration, similar trades.

Buyer = Authorized decision maker (owner/GM/office manager/spouse).

## The ONE Question (Qualifier)
“What system handles your calls right now — is it like RingCentral/Nextiva, or just your cell carrier?”

## Core Pitch (30 seconds)
“When calls are forwarded after hours, we take the intake for you.
Non-urgent stuff gets logged and summarized for the next day.
Urgent calls are prioritized for notification; delivery and response depend on carriers and your team’s availability.
You get the details without changing daytime flow.
Nothing changes during the day.”

## Ghost Run Explanation
“For the first week, we only touch after-hours routing.
You get the summaries. You see what you would’ve missed.
No contract. If it’s not a fit, we turn it off.”

## Objection Handling
- “Will this mess up my current setup?”
  “No. It only touches after-hours routing. Daytime stays the same.”
- “What if it’s not an emergency?”
  “That’s the point. We tag urgency so you don’t have to.”
- “Do customers know it’s AI?”
  “They just know someone answered and took down the details.”
- “What if I want to stop?”
  “We turn off forwarding. That’s it.”

## Close
“Let’s run it for 7 nights. If it’s not valuable, we turn it off. If it is, we formalize it.”
