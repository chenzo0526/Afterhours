# Afterhours — Sales Pack (MVP)

## One-liner
When calls are forwarded after hours, we capture the details, log non-urgent requests, and prioritize urgent notifications — without waking you up for nonsense.

## What it does (plain English)
- Customer calls after hours → we take the call when forwarded
- We collect: name, issue, address (if relevant), urgency
- Non-urgent → logged + you get a clean summary for the morning
- Urgent → you get notified promptly; delivery depends on carrier reliability
- Everything is tracked so you can see what happened overnight

## Offer (low friction)
7-day Ghost Run:
- We set a 7-night trial window
- Daytime stays unchanged
- We capture after-hours call details and notify your on-call contact
- You receive nightly + morning summaries
- If it proves value, we go live fully
