# Afterhours — Pitch (v1)

## 10-second opener
“Hey {{Name}} — I’m Vincenzo. Quick one:
when calls come in after hours, do you actually have someone taking them,
or is it basically voicemail / missed calls?”

## Problem (keep it blunt)
“Missed after-hours calls often mean missed opportunities.
Voicemail means slower follow-up.
And owners get woken up for nonsense.”

## What we do (simple)
“When calls are forwarded after hours, we take the intake calmly.
We collect the details + assess urgency.
Non-urgent gets logged and summarized for the morning.
Urgent is prioritized for notification; delivery and response depend on carriers and your team’s availability.”

## Ghost Run (the low-friction offer)
“First 7 nights is a Ghost Run:
we only touch after-hours routing.
Daytime stays the same.
You get the summaries.
If it’s not a fit, we turn it off.”

## Close
“Want to run it for 7 nights and see the summaries?”
