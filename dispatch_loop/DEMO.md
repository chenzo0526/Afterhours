# Afterhours — Demo Flow (Ghost Run)

Goal: show value for 7 days without changing how the business operates.

## What happens
- Calls come in after hours
- Agent answers, collects details, tags urgency
- System logs every call
- Owner receives:
  - Immediate alert (when SMS is live)
  - Next-morning summary (always)

## What prospect sees
1) Airtable "Calls" log filling up automatically
2) A clean daily summary email (copy/pasteable into their CRM)
3) Proof of missed calls + what they would have booked

## Ghost Run Setup
- No number porting needed
- No customer-facing change required
- We forward their after-hours calls (or use their existing voicemail flow if needed)
