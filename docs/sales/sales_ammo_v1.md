# Afterhours AI - Sales Ammo v1

## 30-second pitch (spoken)
We answer every call after hours, same as your top dispatcher would. We book the job, capture the details, and text you the lead in real time. You stop losing calls at night, on weekends, and during storms. No missed money. No extra headcount. We work inside your process, not around it.

## Discovery questions (pain fast)
1) How many calls hit after 5pm and on weekends?
2) What happens when a new customer reaches voicemail?
3) How often do you lose a job because nobody picked up?

## Closing lines
- Want to run this for 14 days and see the missed calls turn into booked jobs?
- If we book you two extra jobs a month, does this pay for itself?
- Give me one night. If we fail, you shut it off.
- Let’s start with overflow calls and expand if it works.
- Pick a start date and I will handle the rest.

## Objection rebuttals
**"I already have voicemail"**
- Voicemail is a dead end. We answer live and secure the job while the customer is hot.

**"My dispatcher handles it"**
- Great. We back them up after hours and on overflow so they don’t burn out.

**"I don’t get many calls"**
- That makes every call more valuable. We make sure you don’t miss the few you do get.

**"AI will piss customers off"**
- We speak like a human dispatcher. If it can’t help, it routes to you fast. No awkward loops.

**"Seems expensive"**
- One missed job costs more than a month with us. We’re cheaper than one bad week.

## Proof Points
- 24/7 answer rate
- No missed calls after hours
- Lead details captured every time
- Real-time text alerts
- Live transfer when needed

## Call center competitor teardown
Traditional call centers read a script, take a message, and move on. They don’t book the job or drive the next step. Afterhours AI does. We keep the customer engaged, lock in the appointment, and hand you a ready-to-run lead. Same cost, higher close rate, less noise.
