## Cold Email Sequence (Plumbing)

### Email 1: Missed Calls = Lost Jobs
**Subject line options**
- Missed calls are missed jobs
- Quick fix for after-hours leads
- Stop losing emergency calls

Hi {{first_name}} — when the phone rings after hours and no one answers, that job goes to the next plumber. One missed call can mean a lost emergency ticket and a lost customer.

We make sure every after-hours call is answered, captured, and sent to you so you can decide what to take.

PS: One emergency call usually pays for a month.

### Email 2: Owner Sleep Disruption
**Subject line options**
- You shouldn’t lose sleep over calls
- After-hours coverage, minus the wake-ups
- Sleep through the night, keep the jobs

Hi {{first_name}} — if you’re the one fielding every late-night call, your sleep gets wrecked and your mornings suffer. That’s a fast path to burnout for any owner-operator.

We handle after-hours answering and only send you what truly needs your attention, so you can rest and still stay on top of urgent jobs.

### Email 3: Call Center vs Voicemail vs Us
**Subject line options**
- Call center vs voicemail vs us
- After-hours options for plumbers
- A simpler way to cover nights

Hi {{first_name}} — voicemail loses callers, and call centers can feel impersonal and pricey. We sit in the middle: automated after-hours answering that keeps callers engaged, collects the right details, and routes messages fast.

You get the benefit of coverage without the overhead, and customers feel taken care of.
