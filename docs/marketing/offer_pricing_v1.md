# Afterhours AI Pricing + Offer Narrative (v1)

Two packages. Two lanes. Pick one and move.

Anchor: a basic call center costs $250–$400 per month. One saved emergency call can pay for this whole thing.

## Packages

### Core
What’s included:
- Afterhours AI answers and triages after-hours calls.
- Captures caller name, issue, and urgency.
- Delivers a clean call summary to your team.
- Business-hours setup and a short runbook.

Who it’s for:
- Owner-operator trades who want fewer 2 a.m. wakeups.
- Small teams that need coverage without payroll.

### Managed
What’s included:
- Everything in Core.
- We handle setup, tuning, and ongoing updates.
- Priority support with faster response.
- Monthly review + adjustments.

Who it’s for:
- Busy contractors who want zero admin.
- Shops with higher call volume and higher stakes.

## 10-second ROI
If this saves just one true emergency call a month, it usually pays for itself.  
Compared to $250–$400/month for a call center, this is a cheaper, more consistent safety net.

## Why not voicemail
Voicemail doesn’t answer questions, doesn’t triage urgency, and callers don’t leave good info when they’re stressed. You lose jobs or you wake up for non-emergencies.

## Why not a call center
Call centers are expensive, slow to learn your business, and still miss context. You pay $250–$400/month and still get bad handoffs.
