# 10-Minute Onboarding: 1–4 Location Plumbing Business

Goal: start forwarding calls the same day with a simple, owner-led setup. No integrations, no scheduling workflows, no complexity.

## A) The 4 Questions We Must Ask
1) "Who should get emergency calls after hours?"
2) "What counts as an emergency for your plumbing business?"
3) "If the first person doesn’t respond, who is next?"
4) "What’s the best number to reach you as the owner?"

## B) Allowed Answer Formats
1) Checkbox
2) Free text
3) Single select
4) Free text

## C) Default Settings (If Owner Doesn’t Choose)
- Emergency contact: Owner
- Emergency definition: Use the default checklist in section D
- Escalation: Owner only (no secondary contact)
- Owner contact number: The main business number on file

## D) “Emergency Definition” Checklist Template (Plumbing-Specific)
Use as-is or check what applies:
- Active water leak (visible water flow)
- No water to the property (total loss)
- Sewer backup or sewage smell inside
- Burst or frozen pipe
- Water heater leak or no hot water in winter
- Gas line smell near water heater (if applicable)
- Flooding affecting safety or property damage risk
- Commercial client with loss of service
- After-hours call from property manager marked urgent
- Other (free text)

## E) Escalation Routing Rules (Owner vs Tech vs Manager)
- If emergency and owner is available: route to Owner
- If emergency and owner is not available: route to Primary Tech
- If emergency and Primary Tech does not respond in 5 minutes: route to Manager
- If non-emergency: send to voicemail and include in Morning Report
