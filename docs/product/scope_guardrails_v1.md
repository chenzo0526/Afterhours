# If it doesn’t capture after-hours emergency calls, we don’t build it.

## Non-negotiable outcomes
- We capture every after-hours emergency call.
- We triage urgency fast and consistently.
- We escalate to the right human, with the right context, every time.
- We deliver a clear morning report that drives action.
- We operate with reliability that earns trust when stakes are high.

## Not now
- Dashboards beyond the morning report.
- Integrations beyond the core call capture path.
- Multi-location routing and complex org hierarchies.
- Appointment scheduling or calendar management.
- Customer portals, chat, or omni-channel support.
- Custom workflows or automation builders.
- Analytics, BI exports, or data warehousing.
- Brand theming or advanced admin controls.

## Decision filter checklist (yes/no)
- Does this directly improve capture of after-hours emergency calls?
- Does it make urgency triage faster or more accurate?
- Does it reduce failure risk during an escalation?
- Does it strengthen the morning report’s clarity or actionability?
- Does it increase reliability, uptime, or on-call safety?
- Can it be built and maintained without new infrastructure complexity?
- Will it help us close revenue in the next 90 days?

## Manifesto
We are not building a platform. We are building a narrow, reliable system that
captures emergency calls after hours and routes them correctly, every time. If a
feature does not move that outcome or does not help us get paid sooner, it is a
distraction. We will say no by default, ship only what protects the core, and
earn the right to expand once revenue proves the need.
