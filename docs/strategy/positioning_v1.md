Why (buyer psychology)
They buy relief, not software. Too many options feels risky and expensive. Owners want one thing: stop losing jobs and stop getting woken up for junk calls. Keep it dead simple, prove money and sleep saved.

3) ROI & Price Justification Framework
10-second math
- One emergency call = $250–$1,000+
- Save one after-hours job and the service pays for itself
- Every missed call is a customer calling your competitor

Proof points to reuse
- Only ~38% of small business calls are answered live
- 70–85% of callers hang up if they hit voicemail
- Typical small service business loses $50k–$120k/year from missed after-hours calls
- Many already pay $250–$400/month for live answering services
