# Afterhours — Product Lock (v1)

This document defines the ONLY product we sell until v1 is proven.

---

## Product Name
Afterhours — Ghost Run

---

## What We Do (One Sentence)
When calls are forwarded after hours, we capture the details, log them, send a clean summary, and prioritize urgent notifications.

---

## Core Rules (Non-Negotiable)
1. We ONLY handle calls routed to us.
2. We ONLY operate after-hours.
3. Customers keep their existing phone number.
4. Setup requires call forwarding or phone-system routing.
5. No SMS dependency for core value.

---

## Channels (v1)
- Voice: REQUIRED
- SMS: PRIMARY (subject to carrier delivery)
- Email: OPTIONAL (only if configured and functional)

---

## Escalation Logic (v1)
- LOW → log + summary
- MEDIUM → log + summary (next-day follow-up)
- HIGH → prioritized notification + summary

---

## What We Do NOT Support (v1)
- Background listening
- Voicemail parsing
- Partial call interception
- Complex multi-department routing
- Custom flows per customer

---

## Success Criteria
If the business:
- Misses fewer calls
- Sleeps without anxiety
- Has clean call visibility the next morning

The product is working.

---

## Expansion (Explicitly Not v1)
- Multi-recipient notifications
- CRM sync
- Calendar booking
- Dispatch integrations
- Multi-location logic

These only unlock AFTER demand proves itself.
