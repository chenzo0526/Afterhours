### Scenario 9: Medical/Fire Emergency
**Test**: Caller mentions fire or medical emergency. Agent should immediately redirect to 911.

### Scenario 10: Very Unclear Issue
**Test**: Caller describes issue in confusing way. Agent should ask one clarifying question, then proceed with best understanding.
